DF7TV Rotary Encoder

The DF7TV Rotary Encoder repository contains documentation and source code to read rotary encoders, especially to read standard quadrature 2-Bit Gray code rotary encoders.
A finite state machine diagram (FSM) and code for a new "Quarter-Step" state transition table for rotary encoders is presented.

Documentation is located here: https://www.qsl.net/df7tv/download/Quarter-Step_State_Transition_Table_for_Standard_Quadrature_2-Bit_Gray_Code_Rotary_Encoders.pdf
